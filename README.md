# Anonymous Feedback Box - Smart Contract

## Overview

The `AnonymousFeedbackBox` smart contract allows users to submit anonymous feedback securely, with the feedback being stored in a decentralized and tamper-proof way. The feedback is stored as an IPFS hash, ensuring privacy and security. Only the contract's admin can view the feedback.

## Features

- **Submit Anonymous Feedback**: Users can submit feedback without revealing their identity. The feedback is stored as an IPFS hash, ensuring privacy.
- **Admin-Only Access**: The admin is the only entity that can access the feedback stored on the blockchain.
- **Change Admin**: The admin can be changed, allowing for contract management by another address.
- **Feedback Count**: The number of feedback entries can be accessed via a public function.
- **Timestamp**: Each feedback submission includes a timestamp for tracking when it was submitted.

## Why This Contract?

- **Privacy**: Feedback is stored anonymously via IPFS hashes. The actual feedback data never appears directly on the blockchain, ensuring privacy for users.
- **Decentralized**: Storing the feedback on a blockchain guarantees that the data is immutable and accessible at all times, without relying on any centralized server.
- **Security**: Using an IPFS hash ensures the data integrity of the feedback and minimizes the risk of tampering.
- **Flexibility**: The contract allows the admin to change, making it adaptable to new contract management needs.

## How It Works

1. **Submit Feedback**:
   - Any user can submit feedback via the `submitFeedback` function, providing an IPFS hash of the feedback text. The hash points to the feedback data stored off-chain.
2. **Retrieve Feedback**:
   - The admin can use the `getFeedback` function to view feedback by providing the feedback ID. This returns the IPFS hash and the timestamp.
3. **Count Feedback**:

   - The `getFeedbackCount` function allows anyone to retrieve the total number of feedback entries submitted.

4. **Admin Management**:
   - The contract includes the ability to change the admin via the `changeAdmin` function, ensuring that the contract can be managed by a different address if necessary.

## Functions

### `submitFeedback(string calldata ipfsHash)`

- **Description**: Submit anonymous feedback with an IPFS hash.
- **Parameters**:
  - `ipfsHash`: The IPFS hash pointing to the feedback content.
- **Emit**: `FeedbackSubmitted(uint id, string ipfsHash)`

### `getFeedback(uint id) external view onlyAdmin returns (string memory, uint256)`

- **Description**: Retrieve feedback by ID. Only the admin can view the feedback.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id`: The ID of the feedback.
- **Returns**:
  - `ipfsHash`: The IPFS hash of the feedback.
  - `timestamp`: The timestamp of the feedback submission.

### `getFeedbackCount() external view returns (uint)`

- **Description**: Get the total number of feedback entries.
- **Returns**:
  - `feedbackCount`: The total number of feedback entries submitted.

### `changeAdmin(address newAdmin) external onlyAdmin`

- **Description**: Change the admin address.
- **Parameters**:
  - `newAdmin`: The new admin address.

## Security Considerations

- The contract relies on IPFS to store the actual feedback content, so the security of the feedback depends on the IPFS network's reliability.
- Only the admin has access to retrieve the feedback, ensuring that it remains private to others.
- Feedback cannot be changed once submitted, ensuring the immutability of the records.

## Deployment

To deploy the contract, you can use the following steps:

1. Use a tool like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) to compile and deploy the contract.
2. After deployment, the contract can be interacted with using the Ethereum address that deployed the contract.
3. The contractâ€™s admin can be changed by calling the `changeAdmin` function.
